# nomad-kernelmatrix
This is an asynchronous distributed algorithm to compute a huge-scale kernel matrix. The main feature of the algorithm is that the communication costs can be well hidden when executing it on a distributed system. In addition, such an approach can be implemented in both shared-memory and distributed-memory settings.
